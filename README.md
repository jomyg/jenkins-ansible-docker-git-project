# jenkins-ansible-docker-project

## Description:-

This is a DevOps CI/CD pipeline using Git, Jenkins, Ansible and Docker on AWS for deploying a python-flask application in a Docker container.The process should be initiated from a new commit to a specific branch of a GitHub repository. This event kicks off a process that begins building the Docker image. Jenkins supports this event-driven flow using the â€œGitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".

## Architecture


## Setup
1. CI/CD Server
2. Docker Image Build Server
3. Production/Test Server

Here we use amazon linux on these 3 servers.

## CI/CD Server

> One server is with Jenkins and other two servers are test and build

## Jenkins Installation and configuration. 
```
amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
yum install jenkins git ansible -y
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl enable jenkins.service
```
> After the instalation, we can test the jenkins using the below port:
```
http://13.233.16.92:8080/
```

## Let setup the playbook on ansible master server:

```
]# cat /var/deployment/hosts
[build]
172.31.15.203  ansible_user="ec2-user"


[test]
172.31.0.93 ansible_user="ec2-user"
```
```
# vim /var/deployment/hosts
# chmod o=--- /var/deployment/
# chown jenkins /var/deployment/
# ls -ld /var/deployment/
# drwxr-x--- 2 jenkins root 35 Mar 10 11:31 /var/deployment/

# ansible-vault encrypt /var/deployment/main.yml
New Vault password:
Confirm New Vault password:
Encryption successful
#
# ls -l /var/deployment/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    96 Mar 10 11:31 hosts
-rw------- 1 root root 16490 Mar 10 11:35 main.yml
# chmod 644 /var/deployment/main.yml
```

## Ansible Playbook

## Configuring Jenkins
> After the jenkins installation take the admin password from jenkins server using the below path:
```
ec2-user]# cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
<pass>
```
> Unlock the jenkins and install the suggested plugins:

YS4 vare

> Go to Manage jenkins -> Manage plugins -> Availble plugins -> Search for ansible and slect the ansible 1.1 and install without restart.

xi

> After installtion above was completed. Select the restart the when jenkins is completed the installtion. It will restart the jenkins.
> After restart, go to Manage jenkins -> Global tool cofiguration -> Ansible -> Add ansible -> provide the path of exec dir "/bin" -> save
> Lets create a job, Go to New item -> provide a job name and select "Free style project" -> Click Ok

kox

> It will ask a series of question: Provide description and select source code as GIT.
> Provide the git repo url of jenkins and provide the correct branch of your git
